first I do the ipmort random to give a random number.
after that I print the instructions game rules. 
i do a while loop and write while True to run the cose several time until the user wants to stop.
i defined the user choise and give him: 1,2,3 options for rock ,paper,scissors
and the computer choise to choose 1,2,3 random
in the beginning I put a if if the choose the same I print is a tie 
and after that using elif and else commend. to defined who win following is chiose and who lose. and print the results.
at the end I do a output to the player if he wants to quit. 
I use if and else and if he do not choose y for yes the game will over.

## Code input\output\ how to run
 the input of this code is: first to choose 1 for rock 2 for paper and 3 for scissors.
and second if he wants to exit the game he choose no or anything except y if he wants to play again he write "y"
 the output of this code is: if the player and the computer choose the same the output is "it a tie"
if the player win or lose the output print what the player pick and what the computer pick and print if he lose or win.if the player want to play again the output print thank you 
if he chose to quit the game exit.

What do I need to do to run it:just pick your choice.if you want to play again write "y". if you want to exit write "n" or something else 
Give one or two examples of input and output:input("please choose "1" for ROCK, "2" for PAPER, "3" for SCISSORS.")
output:("you picked ROCK computer picked SCISSORS you win (:")
